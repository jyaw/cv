  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Test and analysis engineering professional and project manager experienced in radar test, performance analysis,
    modeling and simulation verification and validation, tool development and data visualization. I
    am currently looking for the next opportunity to apply my data analysis and model validation skill sets.
    I‚Äôm particularly passionate about Type 1 Diabetes technology solutions and
    have been an active user of Nightscout and OpenAPS since 2016
    (<a href="https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/While%20You%20Wait%20For%20Gear/loops-in-progress.html">here I am in the OpenAPS docs</a> üëã).
    Thanks to my industry experience across multiple Missile Defense radars, I have an accomplished
    understanding of radar hardware/software, integration, test, theory, operations and analysis. I
    am an efficient self-starter and possess the skills to meet and exceed project goals. Team
    environments allow me to work at my best, sharing in collective success and learning within the
    group. I am a proficient Matlab developer and have created robust tools for data analysis.
